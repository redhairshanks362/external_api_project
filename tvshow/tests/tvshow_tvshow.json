Move aside, Voltaire. Step back into the shadows, HL Mencken, there's a new kid in town. One can only wonder how many hours Derek Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef d'oeuvre, \"I hate Frasier Crane.\" A lesser critic would have wasted our time by presenting a well-thought out, point-by-point, constructive critique of this show. But, no, not our Mr. Mann. So, dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column arrives on your doorstep, read it, enjoy it, and above all, treasure it. For, one day this man will join the pantheon of the immortals. And, if we're lucky, it'll be one day soon. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane."

Do you know what zhuzhing is? It's like giving it a little kick in the pants. So, let's just take advantage of the fact that the kids are older. We could have a cocktail party on Christmas Eve... just us and the Donahues. So, instead of serving hot cocoa, we could do mixed drinks. And instead of these crappy ornaments that the kids made in school, I could hang seashells and have a beach-themed tree. So, it would still be magic, just adult magic. That sounded dirty, but you know what I mean. A-A-And instead of giving out toys, we could just do a Yankee Swap with adult toys... not adult toys. Toys that adults would like... that are not sexual."

How are we sure? During your time on Earth, every one of your actions had a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe. Every sandwich you ate, every time you bought a magazine, every single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad. You know how some people pull into the breakdown lane when there's traffic? And they think to themselves, \"Ah, who cares? No one's watching.\" We were watching. Surprise. [audience laughs] Anyway, when your time on Earth has ended, we calculate the total value of your life using our perfectly accurate measuring system. Only the people with the very highest scores, the true cream of the crop, get to come here, to the Good Place. What happens to everyone else, you ask? Don't worry about it. The point is, you are here because you lived one of the very best lives that could be lived. And you won't be alone. Your true soul mate is here too. That's right. Soul mates are real. One of the other people in your neighborhood is your actual soul mate, and you will spend eternity together. So welcome to eternal happiness. Welcome to the Good Place. Sponsored by: otters holding hands while they sleep. You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands? That's how you're gonna feel every day."

So I guess what you're saying is I should just tell my boy that if he applies himself, everything gonna be cool.\nGeoffrey: Well, actually, when the earl completed the bridge, he flung himself off it.\nWill: Dude killed himself?\nGeoffrey: Quite.

A rock half this size was sold in Japan for $2 million.\nCaptain Stottlemeyer: Okay.\nAdrian Monk: Well, I knew that I had seen that rock before somewhere. It was in Julie Teeger's aquarium. It was right in front of us the whole time. Here's what happened. There's a tour guide at the museum named Peck. Lyle Peck. Last weekend, he stole the moonrock. It was probably Sunday night after they closed. He waited until the guards were distracted or between shifts. Peck has worked there for years. He's practically a fixture, so he definitely knew the routine.\nCaptain Stottlemeyer: Why didn't the museum report it?\nAdrian Monk: The museum never missed it. They didn't know it was stolen. They still don't. Peck replaced it with an exact duplicate.\nCaptain Stottlemeyer: Wait, you mean this is just a regular rock? Son of a bitch, I stood in line for half an hour just to touch this stupid thing.\nAdrian Monk: Right. But Peck had a problem. He still had to get the moonrock out of the building. They were searching everybody. Even the employees. So since there was no way for him to get it through security, he had to improvise. He hid the rock in the gift shop. Inside one of those aquarium kits. Then he marked the box. He probably planned to have his accomplice, Brian Lemmon, pick it up the next morning.\nCaptain Stottlemeyer: But the girl got there first.\nAdrian Monk: Exactly, Julie Teeger bought it that morning and took it home. The next day Peck tried to steal it, posing as a meter reader. When that didn't work, Brian Lemmon broke in. But he didn't count on Natalie waking up or that pair of scissors.

Well, I'm - dead tired, I have tons of studying to do and we have a little drama going on here at the suite. Rory's small town friend, Lane, is crashing in with us. She got kicked out of her house, and she's in pretty bad shape. She's pretty heavy into the drugs, totally Nancy Spungening it, chasing the dragon, and I kind of have to be here for support. The chick's bouncing off the walls. Yeah. Tomorrow, sure, absolutely. Tonight was tentative, Jamie, I'm sure I told you to pencil it in. Pencil. Okay, bye."

And, in some ways, it really isn't. And I really want to talk to you about it. So, please, call me back or respond to any of my forthcoming telegrams. Okay. Bye-bye."

I feel something rubbing against me. Disgusting animals, these people should be in a cage. We are in a cage. What if I miss the wedding? I got the ring. What will they do? You can't get married without the ring. Oh, I can't breath, I feel faint. Okay, take it easy. It will start moving soon. Think about the people on the concentration camps, what they went through. And hostages, what would you do if you were a hostage? Think about that. This is nothing. No, it's not nothing, it's something. It's a nightmare! Help me! Move it! Come on, move this [bleep] thing! Why isn't it moving?!? What can go wrong with a train!?! It's on tracks, there's no traffic! How can a train get stuck?. Step on the gas! What could it be? You'd think the conductor would explain it to us? \"I'm sorry there's a delay we'll be moving in 5 minutes.\" I wanna hear a voice. What's that on my leg?!"
